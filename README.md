Simple game of life variation using React/Typescript



![Animated dead, sad & happy cells](preview.gif)


These cellular automata rules:
    - Any dead cell with exactly turehree sad neighbors becomes a sad cell.    
    - Any dead cell with exactly two sad neighbors and 1 happy neighbor becomes a sad cell.    
    - Any dead cell with exactly one sad neighbor and 2 happy neighbors becomes a happy cell.
    - Any dead cell with exactly 3 happy neighbors becomes a happy cell.
    - Any sad or happy cell with a combined total of exactly two or three sad or happy neighbours survives.
    
Look at [src/engine.test.ts](https://github.com/rilopez/mostly-happy-cells/blob/master/src/engine.test.ts#L4)  for test code 
asserting those rules.
